# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio


For this project, I was looking to create my very first online portfolio! I have never showcased a collectionof work online, and certianly not anything that I coded from scratch!

In building this page and designing it, I wanted something that reflected the design elements that I like in my life; clean, somewhat minimal with a tech focus, and uncluttered. The page itself serves to act as a showcase for my future projects, as well as be a real-time example of some code that I have learned during the first two weeks of class. 

In completing this project, I now have a main landing page for future employers, coworkers, potential collaborators. It will hopefully serve as a quick snapshot of what I do in my work, and the aesthetics that I value. 

I learned a LOT by doing this project! First and foremost, I have never seen or touched HTML or CSS before in my life, so literally anything seen here is a first run for me! I did learn that there are a large number of resources for code on the internet, so when I have an idea in my head but am not sure how to make that idea translate to the digital medium, I was able to find a way to make it happen thanks to the community of coders on the web. 

I think that my page stands out in that I tried to not just make the page look robotic, but rather have a clean user interface that is intuitive and easy to follow. I am not graphic designer by trade or practice, but I do thinkt hat I will find a passion for creating visually pleasing sites and apps in the future.
